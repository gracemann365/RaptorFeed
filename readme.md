RaptorFeed is a multi-section grid view news app that provides a seamless browsing experience for desktop users while offering an enjoyable swipe-down interaction for mobile users. The app is designed using vanilla front-end technologies, without relying on any frameworks, and it fetches news data from a REST API in JSON format.

## Features

- **Grid View Layout:** RaptorFeed presents news articles in a visually appealing grid view layout for desktop users, allowing them to quickly scan through multiple headlines at once.

- **Swipe-Down Interaction:** On mobile devices, RaptorFeed replicates the swipe-down tendencies seen in Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts. Users can swipe down to view a summary card of each news article.

- **Full News on Click:** Upon clicking a news summary card, users can access the full news article, enabling them to read in-depth and stay informed.

- **Responsive Design:** While primarily built for desktop users, RaptorFeed has been casually adapted for immediate use on mobile devices. The app offers a satisfactory mobile experience with its swipe-down interactions and responsive layout.
